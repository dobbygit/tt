      "Heavy-duty waterproof PVC tarpaulins for various outdoor applications. Using our specialized high frequency sealing machines we are able to custom make tarpaulins to fit your load and storage needs which means the tarps never end up too big or too small. We can also stencil your company name in bold 30cm letters onto the tarp for advertising while the truck is out and identification if the tarp is stolen. We can fit solid brass eyelets to your requirements and have a quick turn-around time on all tarpaulin repairs.",
